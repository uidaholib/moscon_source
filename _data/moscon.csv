Instead of the standard t-shirt or towel, we have, in limited supply, Team MosCon headbands. We chose headbands in part to provide our membership with a handy place to attach their nametags while in the jacuzzi, and also as a  method of identifying the Con-com. (Ours are blue.) The idea was inspired by the film, Buckaroo Banzai. The Team MosCon logo was designed by Jacqualynn Duram and the Japanese was caligraphed by Ellen Thisted. The Japanese is pronounced, ""Tsumetai mizu patororu-tai"" and means ""Cold Water Patrol."" Get one quick. There will be a limited number of them for sale at the registration table.""",,,,,,,,,,,Jacqualynn Duram; Ellen Thisted,,,clothing; souvenirs; Buckaroo Banzai; Jacuzzi Party,science fiction; authors; artists,headband,"Moscow, ID",Moscon Programs Collection,University of Idaho Special Collections,"Educational use includes non-commercial use of text and images in materials for teaching and research purposes.
